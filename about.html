                    Amma’s profound mission of providing education for life, and emphasis on compassion driven research, has shaped Amrita as a unique institution:
                </p>
                <h6 class="block-title side-heading2">Education for life</h6>
                <p class="desc2">
                    There are two types of education: education for living and education for life. Studying to become a professional is education for a living, while, education for life requires an understanding of the essential human values. At Amrita, we believe that education should also impart a culture of the heart, based on enduring values and inner strength. Amrita’s culture of education helps to inculcate in our students the right ethos to be rooted in the values of Dharma (righteousness), Karuna (compassion), and Shraddha (mindfulness). Endowed with qualities of acceptance, patience, self-confidence, perseverance, and enthusiasm, the benefit of humanity will become uppermost in the students’ thoughts, words and actions. They will then pioneer innovative solutions for the benefit of all humankind, leading to sustainable health and prosperity for all. This resonates with the ancient Sanskrit prayer ‘Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu’. It is a reminder of our deeper connection to the entire world around us, “May our work contribute to the happiness of all beings.”
                </p>
                <h6 class="block-title side-heading2">Compassion Driven Research</h6>
                <p class="desc2">
                    Our motivation to pursue research is focused on alleviating major global problems related to poverty, starvation, sickness, environmental pollution, and contamination. We believe that if we could transform compassion from a mere word into a path of action, we would be able to address most of the world’s problems. If we take this step courageously, then our research and its outcomes will have a special impact,  spontaneity, and power. This has translated into many latest advancements and innovations that have culminated in greater societal benefit.
                </p>
                <h6 class="block-title side-heading2">Global Impact</h6>
                <p class="desc2">
                    At Amrita, we stand united in our mission towards solving globally recognized scientific and societal challenges, including environment, development, and health. Amrita stands at the strategic juncture of two streams of cultures: East and West. It is our vision to bring the two together to bridge the divide through meaningful collaborations with world-class universities and innovative approaches that will benefit the entire planet.
